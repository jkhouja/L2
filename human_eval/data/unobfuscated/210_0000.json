Again, they looked around, and spoke to a second key witness (Ismael\u2019s sister, Ol\u00edvia). They agreed she was acting very suspiciously, as she wouldn\u2019t say what she was doing at the time of Ismael\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d. This time, they didn\u2019t all agree.

They established that Ol\u00edvia had also gone swimming, and that their father Leonardo had raked the garden before going to lie down in the hammock.\n\nSpeaker\tLanguage X Statement\tEnglish Translation\tEvidence for the Claim\nC\u00e2ndido\t__(d)__\tShe (Ol\u00edvia) was swimming.\tHe was with Ol\u00edvia last Thursday, when she booked a swimming lesson.\nMargarida\t__(e)__\tYou (Leonardo) were raking the garden.\tHer mom told her Leonardo was coming to rake the garden.\nOl\u00edvia\t__(f)__\tHe (Leonardo) was sleeping in the hammock.\tShe got woken up by Leonardo\u2019s snoring.\nAnt\u00f4nia\t__(g)__\tThey (Leonardo and his brother) were drinking manioc-flour.\tShe saw a dirty cup next to the hammock where Leonardo had been sleeping.\nOl\u00edvia\t__(h)__\tYou (Jos\u00e9) were playing football.\tShe had seen a football going on while she was swimming.\nJo\u00e3o\t__(i)__\tOl\u00edvia was swimming.\tHe had heard Ol\u00edvia swimming in the river.\n",
