    "context": "One morning, Ant\u00f4nia, C\u00e2ndido, Margarida, Jo\u00e3o, Maria, and Em\u00edlio were playing a detective game, in which they had to discover who just \u201cpoisoned\u201d their sleeping friend Ismael! They very quickly decided that he had drunk poisoned manioc-flour, a mixture of cassava (or tapioca) flour and water. When asked why, their responses were as follows:\nSpeaker\tLanguage X Statement\tEnglish Translation\tEvidence for the Claim\nAnt\u00f4nia\tNehi pihke-\u027eapa neekwipi.\tHe drank manioc-flour.\tShe saw him drink it before he fell asleep.\nC\u00e2ndido\tMaye\u0303 pihke-\u027eapa neekwi\u027eehpi.\tIsmael drank manioc-flour.\tHe saw some manioc-flour on his upper lip (like a \u201cmilk moustache\u201d).\nMargarida\tNehi pihke-\u027eapa neekwiwihpi.\tHe drank manioc-flour\tShe had heard him slurping his manioc-flour in the room next door.\nJo\u00e3o\tMaye\u0303 pihke-\u027eapa neekwidepi.\tIsmael drank manioc-flour.\tHe knew that he took some of his sister\u2019s manioc-flour every morning.\nMaria\tNehi pihke-\u027eapa neekwiyenipi.\tHe drank manioc-flour.\tIsmael told her (before falling\nasleep) that he had drunk some.\nEm\u00edlio\tMaye\u0303 pihke-\u027eapa neekwiwihpi.\tIsmael drank manioc-flour.\tHe could smell manioc-flour on Ismael\u2019s breath.\n\nFirst, they suspected Jos\u00e9, so went to his house to investigate. They all concluded Jos\u00e9 was innocent \u2013 he had an alibi! When asked why, their responses were as follows:\n\nSpeaker\tLanguage X Statement\tEnglish Translation\tEvidence for the Claim\nAnt\u00f4nia\tJuse ekweni newi\u027eepipi.\tJos\u00e9 was playing football.\tShe saw him playing football on the field over the road.\nC\u00e2ndido\tJuse ekweni newi\u027eepi\u027eehpi.\tJos\u00e9 was playing football.\tHe saw that both Jos\u00e9 and his football kit were missing.\nMargarida\tJuse ekweni newi\u027eepidepi.\tJos\u00e9 was playing football.\tShe knew it was time for his weekly football match.\nJo\u00e3o\t\u027eihi ekweni \u027eiwi\u027eepipi.\tThey were playing football.\tHe could see Jos\u00e9 playing football with his brother.\nMaria\t\u027eihi ekweni \u027eiwi\u027eepiyenipi.\tThey were playing football.\tShe was told by Jos\u00e9\u2019s mum that he was playing football with his brother.\nEm\u00edlio\t\u027eihi ekweni \u027eiwi\u027eepi\u027eehpi.\tThey were playing football.\tHe saw that Jos\u00e9\u2019s football and both sets of football boots were missing.\n\nNext, they went to Ismael\u2019s house. Again, they looked around, and spoke to a second key witness (Ismael\u2019s sister, Ol\u00edvia). They agreed she was acting very suspiciously, as she wouldn\u2019t say what she was doing at the time of Ismael\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d. This time, they didn\u2019t all agree. When asked what they thought had happened, their responses were as follows:\n\nSpeaker\tLanguage X Statement\tEnglish Translation\tEvidence for the Claim\nAnt\u00f4nia\tO\u0301li natidepi.\tOl\u00edvia was sleeping in the hammock.\tShe believed that Ol\u00edvia always sleeps all morning.\nC\u00e2ndido\t__(a)__\tShe was swimming.\tHe was told by Ismael's dad that Ol\u00edvia had been swimming all morning.\nMargarida\tNahi naishiwihpi.\tShe was swimming.\tShe had heard her in the river earlier.\nJo\u00e3o\tO\u0301li pihke-\u027eapa na\u027eewihpi.\tOl\u00edvia was making manioc-flour.\tHe could smell manioc-flour in the kitchen.\nMaria\t__(b)__\tShe was making manioc-flour.\tHe saw some manioc-flower in her hair.\nEm\u00edlio\tNahi he\u027eeyapa nawusami\u027eehpi.\tShe was raking the garden.\tHe saw that the garden had recently been raked.\n\nWhen Jo\u00e3o and Maria shared their information, they told Ol\u00edvia \u201c__(c)__ maye\u0303 yee\u027ea\u027eehpi!\u201d\nYou killed Ismael!\n\nThey began explaining all of the things they had come across that morning. They established that Ol\u00edvia had also gone swimming, and that their father Leonardo had raked the garden before going to lie down in the hammock.\n\nSpeaker\tLanguage X Statement\tEnglish Translation\tEvidence for the Claim\nC\u00e2ndido\t__(d)__\tShe (Ol\u00edvia) was swimming.\tHe was with Ol\u00edvia last Thursday, when she booked a swimming lesson.\nMargarida\t__(e)__\tYou (Leonardo) were raking the garden.\tHer mom told her Leonardo was coming to rake the garden.\nOl\u00edvia\t__(f)__\tHe (Leonardo) was sleeping in the hammock.\tShe got woken up by Leonardo\u2019s snoring.\nAnt\u00f4nia\t__(g)__\tThey (Leonardo and his brother) were drinking manioc-flour.\tShe saw a dirty cup next to the hammock where Leonardo had been sleeping.\nOl\u00edvia\t__(h)__\tYou (Jos\u00e9) were playing football.\tShe had seen a football going on while she was swimming.\nJo\u00e3o\t__(i)__\tOl\u00edvia was swimming.\tHe had heard Ol\u00edvia swimming in the river.\n",
